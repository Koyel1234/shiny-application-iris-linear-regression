# shiny-application-iris-linear-regression
This repository contains R file for web applicaton made using R for my final evaluation of the course <b>Industrial Data Science with R</b> in Softanbees Technologies Private Limited. The web application is hosted on <b>shinyapps.io</b> site. This application shows details of data, various features and aspects of iris dataset, implementation of Linear Regression on this dataset. Also, it will show the selected feature set for baseline model to start work with iris dataset. Further analysis and transformations can be performed to get better model than this.
